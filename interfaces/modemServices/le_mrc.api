 * information. It returns a reference of le_mrc_NeighborCellsRef_t type.
 *
 * When the neighboring cells information is no longer needed, you must call
 * le_mrc_DeleteNeighborCellsInfo() to free all allocated resources associated with the
 * object.
 *
 * Then, you can use the following function to get the information:
 * - le_mrc_GetFirstNeighborCellInfo() and le_mrc_GetFirstNeighborCellInfo() allow to go among
 *   the single cell information retrieved with le_mrc_GetNeighborCellsInfo(). These two functions
 *   return a reference of le_mrc_CellInfoRef_t type.

 *
 * A sample code can be seen in the following page:
 * - @subpage c_mrcNeighborCells
 *
 * @section le_mrc_jamming Jamming detection
 *
 * The jamming detection algorithm is based on power measurements and cell synchronization actions
 * performed during a GSM network scan procedure.
 * During this procedure some intermediate results are reported, that allows user to take some
 * preventive actions if necessary.
 * This result is reported as a jammed state probability. See @ref le_mrc_JammingStatus_t
 * enumeration for probability description.
 * Each time the jamming status changes during the scan procedure, it is reported to the user.
 * See @ref le_mrc_JammingReport_t enumeration for details.
 *
 * The jamming status is reported:
 * - In an unsolicited way, each time the protocol stack initiates a scan for PLMN selection or
 * reselection.
 * - On user demand, when a user PLMN scan is performed.
 *
 * Call le_mrc_StartJammingDetection() to launch jamming monitoring.
 * By registering a handler by calling le_mrc_AddJammingDetectionEventHandler(), the notification
 * on jamming detection can be sent to the registered application.
 *
 * For each jamming detection monitoring, the following APIs can be called:
 * - le_mrc_StartJammingDetection() to start the jamming monitoring.
 * - le_mrc_StopJammingDetection() to stop the jamming monitoring.
 * - le_mrc_AddJammingDetectionEventHandler() to register an event handler.
 * - le_mrc_RemoveJammingDetectionEventHandler() to remove an event handler.
 *
 * @section le_mrc_sar SAR backoff
 * SAR (Specific Absorption Rate) is a measure of RF energy absorption by the human body.
 * Users can dynamically select a pre-configured SAR backoff state so they can adjust the SAR
 * depending on their needs.  To manage SAR backoff, these API should be used:
 * - le_mrc_SetSarBackoffState() to set a new SAR backoff state.
 * - le_mrc_GetSarBackoffState() to get the current SAR backoff state.
 * This feature may be unsupported by some targets. Also, the number of supported states may vary
 * depending on the target. Please refer to @ref platformConstraintsMdc for further details.
