 * Cgroups, short for control groups, is a Linux kernel feature that allows hierarchal groupings of
 * processes.  Each group can then be configured with specific attributes that apply to the entire
 * group.  Control groups should not be confused with process groups as this is a different concept.
 *
 * A cgroup can contain other sub-groups and can be arranged in a tree structure similar to
 * directories in a file system.  However, unlike a file system cgroups can have multiple roots.
 * These separate cgroup trees are called hierarchies.  For example, a system's cgroups could be
 * arranged in the following manner:
 *
 * @verbatim
                   Hierarchy1                      Hierarchy2
                     /    \                          /     \
                group1    group2                 group1    group2
                /    \                                         \
          subgroup1  subgroup2                             subgroup1
@endverbatim
 *
 * Attributes that a cgroup can have are available through kernel sub-systems.  For example,
 * the memory sub-system can be used to set the memory limit for all processes in a cgroup.  A
 * hierarchy must have at least one sub-system attached to it and in general a sub-system can only
 * be attached to a single hierarchy.
 *
 * A process can only be a part of one cgroup in each hierarchy.  Having separate hierarchies allows
 * for more flexible control of cgroups.
 *
 * In practice cgroups are used mainly for limiting system resources.
 *
 *
 * @section c_cgrp_layout Hierarchy Layout
 *
 * In this implementation of cgroups each sub-system is attached to its own hierarchy.  In other
 * words there is a one-to-one mapping of hierarchy and sub-systems so the terms hierarchy and
 * sub-system will be used interchangeably henceforth.
 *
 *
 * @section c_cgrp_init Initialization
 *
 * On system start-up the cgrp_Init() function must be called to setup the hierarchies.  Cgroups are
 * by default non-persistent so cgrp_Init() must called every time the system starts.
 *
 *
 * @section c_cgrp_create Creating cgroups
 *
 * To create a cgroup for a sub-system call cgrp_Create().
 *
 *
 * @section c_cgrp_settingAttributes Setting cgroup Attributes
 *
 * Cgroups created for a specific sub-system can only set attributes specific to that sub-system.
 * For example:
 *
 * @code
 *      // cgroup created for the cpu sub-system.
 *      cgrp_Create(CGRP_SUBSYS_CPU, "MyApp");
 *
 *      // cgroup created for the memory sub-system with the same name.  This is a separate cgroup
 *      // but it can have the same name because it is in a different hierarchy.
 *      cgrp_Create(CGRP_SUBSYS_MEM, "MyApp");
 *
 *      // Set the cpu share for the cgroup in the cpu sub-system to half of the default value.
 *      cgrp_cpu_SetShare("MyApp", 512);
 *
 *      // Set the memory limit for the cgroup in the memory sub-system.
 *      cgrp_mem_SetLimit("MyApp", 100);
 * @endcode
 *
 *
 * @section c_cgrp_addingProcesses Adding Processes to a cgroup
 *
 * Processes can be added to a cgroup, by PID, using cgrp_AddProc().  If a process already belonging
 * to a cgroup is added to another cgroup in the same hierarchy, the process is moved but not copied
 * to the second cgroup, because processes can only be in one cgroup per hierarchy.
 *
 * Processes that are forked by other processes always inherit the cgroup of their parent.
 *
 * When a process dies it is automatically removed from all cgroups it belongs to.
 *
 * @section c_cgrp_delete Deleting cgroups
 *
 * To delete a cgroup call cgrp_Delete().  Cgroups can only be deleted if they do not contain any
 * processes.
 *
 *
 * @section c_cgrp_threadSafety Thread Safety
 *
 * The functions in this API are not thread safe.  Other synchronization methods must be used to
 * control concurrent access to the cgroups.

/**
 * Sets the cpu share of a cgroup.
 *
 * Cpu share is used to calculate the cpu percentage for a process relative to all other processes
 * in the system.  Newly created cgroups and processes not belonging to a cgroup are given a default
 * value of 1024.  The actual percentage of the cpu given to a process is calculated as:
 *
 * (share value of process) / (sum of shares from all processes contending for the cpu)
 *
 * All processes within a cgroup share the available cpu share for that cgroup.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * cgroupA is configured with the default share value, 1024.
 * cgroupB is configured with 512 as its share value.
 * cgroupC is configured with 2048 as its share value.
 *
 * cgroupA has one process running.
 * cgroupB has two processes running.
 * cgroupC has one process running.
 *
 * Assuming that all processes in cgroupA, cgroupB and cgroupC are running and not blocked waiting
 * for some I/O or timer event and that another system process is also running.
 *
 * Sum of all shares (including the one system process) is 1024 + 512 + 2048 + 1024 = 4608
 *
 * The process in cgroupA will get 1024/4608 = 22% of the cpu.
 * The two processes in cgroupB will share 512/4608 = 11% of the cpu, each process getting 5.5%.
 * The process in cgroupC will get 2048/4608 = 44% of the cpu.
 * The system process will get 1024/4608 = 22% of the cpu.
