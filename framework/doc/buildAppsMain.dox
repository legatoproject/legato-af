Legato Application Framework is designed to <b>simplify embedded IoT development</b> and connect
your applications to the cloud and network services.  Developers do not need in-depth knowledge of
embedded systems to be able to develop on IoT devices with Legato.  Legato provides <b>an
extensive C Runtime Library, a set of management daemons, build and target management tools and
built-in security</b> enabling you to focus on developing your applications.

<h1> What is the Legato Application Framework? </h1>

The Legato Application Framework <b>provides rich tools and APIs</b> for developers to build embedded
system applications. The framework simplifies the complexity of interfacing the underlying Operating
System with hardware, and introduces <b>layers of security</b> to ensure applications having necessary
permissions to access resources. Such applications run in an isolated environment and its permissions
can be explicitly configured.

<b>The Legato AF provides:</b>
- A @ref c_APIs that provides many APIs to enable low-level routines and commonly used data
  structures and OS service APIs.
- @ref basicRuntimeArch "Core Daemons" that provide secure services to run and manage your
  applications.
- A set of @ref tools "Command Line Tools" for both your target and your development machine to
  ease the configuration and administration of deploying applications and configuring your target
  device.
- Built-in native security where all applications by default run in isolated Sandboxes and have to
  be given permissions to interact with applications outside of the Sandbox.
- The ability to plug in applications/services provided by your Processor Vendor or other
  developers that you can then take and connect to your applications.
- The ability to bundle OS drivers within your applications to allow connection to hardware without
  modifying the underlaying platform.

<h1> Why Choose the Legato Application Framework? </h1>

- An Open Source Framework that allows full customization of all components.
- Provides well defined patterns that allow for the encapsulation of varying hardware and
  associated applications.
- Provides a robust set of @ref tools "Command Line Tools" that enable the configuration and
  administration of devices.
- Ability to run your applications in @ref basicSecuritySandbox "secure containers" with resource
  management and monitoring, while still allowing cross application communication.
- @ref toolsBuild "Developer tools" that help you troubleshoot interprocess communications, package
  up applications, components, and kernel drivers into a customized system and then deploy the
  system to your target.
