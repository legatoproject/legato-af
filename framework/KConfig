config REDUCE_FOOTPRINT
  bool "Reduce memory and storage use where possible"
  default n
  ---help---
  Try to reduce the memory and storage footprint of Legato.  This may use

  Use memory pools for dynamic memory allocation.  Memory pools help prevent
  memory fragmentation, but require that the pools be sized appropriately for
  the application.
  Disabling this option will still allocate memory using the memory pool
  interface (le_mem), but switches the internal behaviour to use malloc and
  free on a per-block basis.  This allows tools like Valgrind to accurately
  track the allocations and de-allocations at the cost of potential memory
  fragmentation.

  depends on LINUX
  default y
  ---help---
  When a segmentation fault occurs, use signal derivation and
  sigsetjmp()/siglongjmp() to try and survive the invalid memory access long
  enough to generate a backtrace.  This handler relies on undefined behaviour
  of sigsetjmp() and is therefore not guaranteed to work.
