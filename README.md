Welcome to Legato!
==================

#### Dependencies

  - Ubuntu 12.04 or newer.
  - Packages required:

        bison flex build-essential chrpath cifs-utils cmake coreutils curl desktop-file-utils
        diffstat docbook-utils doxygen fakeroot flex g++ gawk gcc git-core gitk graphviz
        help2man libgmp3-dev libmpfr-dev libreadline6-dev libtool libxml2-dev libxml-libxml-perl
        make m4 python-pip python-jinja2 python-pysqlite2 quilt samba scons sed subversion
        texi2html texinfo unzip wget

  - Cross toolchain(s).

#### Installation

 To install the Legato framework on your development PC,

  1. unzip/untar it into a directory

  2. cd into that directory

  3. run ```make```

  4. To configure your bash shell's environment for the Legato application build tools,
     source ```bin/configlegatoenv```:

        $ . bin/configlegatoenv

    OR, run the interactive bash shell ```bin/legs```:

        $ bin/legs

  5. To build support for cross-build targets, run ```make <target>```.
    For example, to enable support for the Sierra Wireless AR7xxx devices, run ```make ar7```.
    Of course, each of these depends on the cross-build tool chain for that target,
    so ensure that you have the appropriate tool chain installed first.

    If your toolchain is installed somewhere other than under ```/opt/swi```,
    ensure that the appropriate environment variable is set to the path of
    the directory containing your toolchain.
    For example, for AR7 devices, ```AR7_TOOLCHAIN_DIR``` must be set to the path of the directory
    that contains the file ```arm-poky-linux-gnuabi-gcc```.

     Following is a list of supported cross-build targets:

Target |  Description                    | Environment variable
:------|---------------------------------|:-----------------------
   ar7 | Sierra Wireless AR7xxx module   | ```AR7_TOOLCHAIN_DIR```
   wp7 | Sierra Wireless WP7xxx module   | ```WP7_TOOLCHAIN_DIR```

#### Documentation

 Once you have completed the first three installation steps above, you will find a set of
 HTML documentation under the "Documentation" directory.  Point your web browser at
 ```Documentation/index.html``` to view it.

#### Uninstallation

 To uninstall Legato from your development PC:

  - Delete the directory you unzipped Legato under
  - Revert any changes you may have made to your ```.bashrc```, etc. to set up ```XXX_TOOLCHAIN_DIR```
    environment variables.


#### Directory Structure

 The top level directory structure is as follows:

   ```./airvantage``` - contains the Sierra Wireless Air Vantage(tm) M2M cloud connector agent.

   ```./bin``` - created by build system and populated with executable files that run on the development
           host (the host that ran the build).

   ```./build``` - contains the results of a framework build.  Will be created by the build system.

   ```./build/tools``` - contains tools that are built and then used by the build system to build
                   other things.

   ```./build/<target>``` - contains the output of a build for a specific target (e.g., ./build/wp7).

   ```./build/<target>/staging``` - things in here get copied to the target system when instlegato
                              is run.

   ```./buildTools``` - contains the source code for build tools (when built, the appear in
                  ./build/tools).

   ```./cmake``` - contains CMake scripts used by the build system.

   ```./framework``` - contains the source code for the Legato framework itself.

   ```./targetFiles``` - contains files that are for installation on target devices.
